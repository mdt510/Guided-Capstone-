We want to refit the model using all available data. But should we include Big Mountain data? On the one hand, we are _not_ trying to estimate model performance on a previously unseen data sample, so theoretically including Big Mountain data should be fine. One might first think that including Big Mountain in the model training would, if anything, improve model performance in predicting Big Mountain's ticket price. But here's where our business context comes in. The motivation for this entire project is based on the sense that Big Mountain needs to adjust its pricing. One way to phrase this problem: we want to train a model to predict Big Mountain's ticket price based on data from _all the other_ resorts! We don't want Big Mountain's current price to bias this. We want to calculate a price based only on its competitors."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gdo7411pMTar"},"source":["X = ski_data.loc[ski_data.Name != \"Big Mountain Resort\", 'AdultWeekday']\n","y = ski_data.loc[ski_data.Name != \"Big Mountain Resort\", 'AdultWeekend']"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"x-dQLkI3MTa9","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1603387225854,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":782,"user":{"displayName":"ash yousefi","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi-Z0KPy1WV5RKBZXuRYodD0CDrP2UJUG-YWbmzGrE=s64","userId":"08683032005502717915"}},"outputId":"f30b2b91-1de8-4680-b30a-ac7c5d4e7ead","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":163}},"source":["len(X), len(y)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-2-138fc7957cab>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mlen\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mX\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mlen\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0my\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'X' is not defined"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iF4bQpqjMTbK","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1603387034885,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":607,"user":{"displayName":"Matthew Tombers","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ghi9If9kpsKUgEFU1qQd7Itl_cRNnWDJKDW0eM42g=s64","userId":"07438049268056779868"}},"outputId":"0e0bb95f-50a3-4d6c-959a-420a5014b8c3","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":936}},"source":["model.fit(X, y)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"ValueError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mValueError\u001b[0m                                Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-9-6d10fe8973eb>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mmodel\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mfit\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mX\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0my\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;32m/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sklearn/pipeline.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36mfit\u001b[0;34m(self, X, y, **fit_params)\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    348\u001b[0m             \u001b[0mThis\u001b[0m \u001b[0mestimator\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    349\u001b[0m         \"\"\"\n\u001b[0;32m--> 350\u001b[0;31m         \u001b[0mXt\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mfit_params\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mself\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0m_fit\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mX\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0my\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m**\u001b[0m\u001b[0mfit_params\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m    351\u001b[0m         with _print_elapsed_time('Pipeline',\n\u001b[1;32m    352\u001b[0m                                  self._log_message(len(self.steps) - 1)):\n","\u001b[0;32m/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sklearn/pipeline.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m_fit\u001b[0;34m(self, X, y, **fit_params)\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    313\u001b[0m                 \u001b[0mmessage_clsname\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'Pipeline'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    314\u001b[0m                 \u001b[0mmessage\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0mself\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0m_log_message\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mstep_idx\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m--> 315\u001b[0;31m                 **fit_params_steps[name])\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m    316\u001b[0m             \u001b[0;31m# Replace the transformer of the step with the fitted\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    317\u001b[0m             \u001b[0;31m# transformer.

Start by starting the current position; how much does Big Mountain currently charge? What does your modelling suggest for a ticket price that could be supported in the marketplace by Big Mountain's facilities?

Discuss the additional operating cost of the new chair lift per ticket (on the basis of each visitor on average buying 5 day tickets) in the context of raising prices to cover this. For future improvements, state which, if any, of the modeled scenarios you'd recommend for further consideration.
